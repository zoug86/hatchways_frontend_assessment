# Student Repository

This project displays general information about class students and is hosted at (Vercel hosting) [Student Repository](https://student-repository.vercel.app/).

## General Idea
This application is created with create-react-app and uses context hooks to manage global state (you can try using REDUX, but the project size does not really need it).

The application displays 25 students rendered from a public [API](https://api.hatchways.io/assessment/students/).

One student looks as follows:
```JSON
{
    "city": "FushÃ«-Muhurr",
    "company": "Yadel",
    "email": "iorton0@imdb.com",
    "firstName": "Ingaberg",
    "grades": [
        "78",
        "100",
        "92",
        "86",
        "89",
        "88",
        "91",
        "87"
    ],
    "id": "1",
    "lastName": "Orton",
    "pic": "https://storage.googleapis.com/hatchways-app.appspot.com/assessments/data/frontend/images/voluptasdictablanditiis.jpg",
    "skill": "Oracle"
},
```

## Added Features
- Toggle plus/minus button: toggling the plus button allows to display full student course grades and hiding it.
- An input filed to add tags to the student.
- 2 input fields for filtering and searching pusposes; one input that is based on name search (first and last name) and one input for tags search.
